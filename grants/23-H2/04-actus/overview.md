## Strategic Objective

- Abstrakta is a dissemination and sharing platform for the upcycling of multidisciplinary, near-time pre-publication research. We turn unused academic research into licensable (non-transferable) NFTs. It’s for everyone– from academics to commercial entities to independent researchers.  Abstrakta’s users can share their near-time portfolio and allow for their research “leftovers” to be used in other publications and/or licensed for commercial use, all while being cited for their work and growing their professional reputation.  Abstrakta runs on open-source and decentralised principles and it has built-in exploitation resistance through several mechanisms including a dispute resolution protocol and meta and community level governance in which all users have a vote.

- We support transparent and open source scientific research by providing a home for all research, originating from both academic and/or independent sources, including research which is currently not being shared due to a lack of fit into traditional publications. Besides the product itself being a tool for allowing open source scientific research, Abstrakta itself will be built on open source principles, allowing anyone to contribute to its development. We believe in a multidisciplinary approach and encourage others from the community to join the development and governance of our project.
